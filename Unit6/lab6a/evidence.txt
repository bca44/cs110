Our office interviewed Dr. Bean about his recent
purchase of 1,000 hours of ChatGPT time. He claimed
that he was working with Dr. Page to create a bot
that could work as a CS 110 TA. However, records
recovered from the office of Dr. Zappala indicate
that the bot was in the process of learning CS
so well that Dr. Bean was planning to use it to
teach all of his courses. This scheme involved
teaching remotely with an automated video creating
bot, perfectly simulating the likeness of Dr. Bean.
Furthermore, our office discovered evidence of bribes to Dr.
Page and Dr. Zappala so they would not reveal his plans
to the CS Department.
